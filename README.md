# Data-Preprocessing-in-ML
A collection of essential data preprocessing techniques in Machine Learning â€” including handling missing values, encoding, scaling, outlier treatment, and more.


This repository contains a collection of essential **data preprocessing techniques** used in Machine Learning pipelines. These steps ensure the data is clean, structured, and ready for model training.

## ðŸ§° Topics Covered
- Handling Missing Values (mean, mode, median)
- Encoding Categorical Variables (Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding)
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Outlier Detection & Treatment
- Feature Selection & Cleaning
- Data Splitting (Train/Test)
